# If you helm chart installed is 0.1.46 - it will use latest-1.4.6 image
# Please consult SENSE team if any changes needed, but usually no.
# During upgrade process - new helm chart will take new image of specified version of helm.
# latest - Latest stable version (might be not from same helm release and missing Helm features)
# dev - Development release (use with caution)
# pullPolicy: Always - Always pull image from repository (that is default) Overwrite if needed.

# Resources for Frontend. This should not require any changes for a single network device control;

# Persistent volume claim for Frontend.
# This should not require any changes if you run ceph and no others are supported yet.
# If you have another storage class, change it (no guarantees to work and might need manual configuration)
# If you set it to false - there is no guarantees for persistent storage (and data might be lost at pod restart)
