# Resources for Frontend. This should not require any changes for a single network device control;

# Persistent volume claim for Frontend.

# SSL Certificate parameters:
# It does support getting certificate from cert-manager or
# from files directory inside this chart.
# Below are 3 options supported by SiteRM Helm Charts.
# Cert-manager depends on Kubernetes cluster and supported options.
# Please check with your Kubernetes cluster administrator, which option is supported (ClusterIssuer, Issuer, Or none - in this case use Option 3)
# ===================================================================================
# Option 1: CERT MANAGER + ClusterIssuer
# ClusterIssuer is a cluster-scoped resource, usable across all namespaces.
#certmanager: true
#certmanager_params:
#  commonName: "hostname-replace-me"
#  dnsNames:
#    - "hostname-replace-me"
#  issuerRef:
#    group: cert-manager.io
#    kind: ClusterIssuer
#    name: incommon-v2-prod   # REPLACE BASED on your ClusterIssuer Name.
#  privateKey:
#    algorithm: RSA
#    encoding: PKCS1
#    size: 4096
# ===================================================================================
# Option 2: CERT MANAGER + Issuer
# An Issuer is a namespaced resource, usable only within the same namespace it's defined in.
# Set the correct location to hostcert and hostkey inside files directory
# In case of cert manager - set certmanager to true
# and all certmanager related parameters
#certmanager: true
#certmanager_params:
#  commonName: "hostname-replace-me-if-deployment"
#  dnsNames:
#    - "hostname-replace-me-if-deployment"
#  duration: 720h0m0s
#  issuerRef:
#    group: cert-manager.io
#    kind: Issuer
#    name: sense-issuer-agent  # Name of issuer must match issuer_params:name
#   renewBefore: 120h0m0s
#  privateKey:
#    algorithm: RSA
#    encoding: PKCS1
#    size: 4096
# Name of issuer must be same as used in certmanager_params:issuerRef:name
# Email address for registering to server (e.g. LetsEncrypt requires that)
#issuer: true
#issuer_params:
#  name: sense-issuer-agent # Name of issuer must match certmanager_params:issuerRef:name
#  email: "myemailaddress@somedomain.com"
#  server: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
# ===================================================================================
# Option 3: Manual Certificates
# If you plan to define your own hostcert and hostkey, set certmanager: false
# And in this case usehostcert: true
# Also update hostcert and hostkey values.
# IMPORTANT!!!!
# Spacing is important, make sure to keep it at 2 spaces, which points to line beginning inside file (as this is a YAML file and need structure)
